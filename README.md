ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dattali18, a third-year software engineering student with a specialization in AI, ML, and Data Science. I'm passionate about software development and have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies:

- Python (20-25K lines)
- Swift (15K lines)
- C# (10-14K lines)
- Java (10K lines)
- C++ (5-8K lines)
- JavaScript (TypeScript)
- HTML/CSS

I build native iOS apps using SwiftUI and backend systems with ASP.NET in C#. I've also worked on school projects in Java, C++, and Python.

Currently, I'm learning full-stack development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (TypeScript), and React. I'm self-taught in many languages and frameworks and enjoy tackling new challenges in the field.
