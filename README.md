# Experience

## App Development

I build native iOS apps using SwiftUI and backend systems with ASP.NET in C#. I've also worked on school projects in Java, C++, and Python.

### Technologies

- ASP.NET
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Core Data
- .NET Core
- Entity Framework
- Restful APIs
- Database Design
- SQL
- ORM

### Repos

- [iOS app for course management `SwiftUI`](https://github.com/dattali18/UX-Prototype)
- [Native Windows app using `WPF` and `C#`](https://github.com/dattali18/WPF-.NET-Project)
- [Backend for a school project `C#`, `RestAPI`](https://github.com/dattali18/WindowsSystem-Backend)
- [A database system for airport `SQL`](https://github.com/dattali18/SQL-Project)

## Web Development

I have experience with web development and have built websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
used React for front-end development and Node.js for back-end development.

### Technologies

- React (Js, TypeScript)
- Node.js

### Repos 

- [Frontend for a school project `React`](https://github.com/dattali18/Windows-System-Frontend-React)
- [Backend for a school project `C#`](https://github.com/dattali18/WindowsSystem-Backend)
- [A simple website to see and analyze the repo of github users `React`](https://github.com/dattali18/GitHub-user-search)

## Machine Learning and Data Science

I have created a few projects using machine learning and data science, such as a sentiment analysis model using Python and a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.

I have written a C++ Math library using C++20 and CMake, this library is used for machine learning and data science projects, this project is on going and helping me learn more about C++ and CMake, And deep dive into the math behind machine learning and data science.

### Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Repos

- [AI-Agents `Python`, `PyTorch`](https://github.com/dattali18/AI-Agent-Framwork)
- [C++ Math Library `C++20`, `CMake`](https://github.com/dattali18/CPP-Math-Library)
- [Collection of AI and ML algorithms `Python`](https://github.com/dattali18/AI_Algorithm)

currently I'm learning about deep learning and neural networks using PyTorch and TensorFlow
and also big data using the `R` programming language

## Game Development

I have created a few games using Python's Pygame library, and developed an AI framework for games using Python and PyTorch.

I have written a Ray tracing engine using Java17, this project is more than 10k lines of code.

### Technologies

- Pygame
- PyTorch
- Java17

### Repos

- [Ray Tracing Engine `Java17`](https://github.com/dattali18/Ray-Tracing-Engine)

## Amount of code written

I have use a tool that scan a GitHub repo and give the number of lines of code in the repo for the top repo this is the result

<img src="/lines-of-code.png" alt="Lines of Code" height="500"/>

I have use the `cloc` tool in order to count the amount of code I have written in the past 3-4 years and here is the result

> Note: the data might not be up to date
> since I have written more code since the last time I ran the tool
